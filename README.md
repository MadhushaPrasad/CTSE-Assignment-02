# CTSE-Assignment-02

##### Objective

Design and implement a prototype of a secure, microservice-based application component
using fundamental DevOps practices and cloud capabilities.

##### Assignment Overview

Your group is tasked with creating a prototype for a single, key component of a larger
microservice-based application. This should be deployed on a public cloud service provider.
You have the option to choose from any cloud service provider of your choice. The final
deliverable should demonstrate basic DevOps practices, security considerations including
DevSecOps practices, and cloud capabilities.

##### Specific Tasks

- Design a Simple Microservice (LO1, LO3)
- Choose a core component of a larger application idea (e.g., product catalog for ecommerce, etc.).
- Outline the functionality and endpoints of this microservice.
- You can choose any programming language/ framework of your choice.
- Implement Basic DevOps Practices (LO1, LO2)
- The code should be hosted in version controlling system. Make sure itâ€™s a public
  repository.
- Use CI/CD pipelines to automate the build and deployment process for the
  microservice.
- Containerize the Microservice using Docker (LO3, LO4)
- Your microservice should be containerized.
- Use any existing container registry service to host your container image. The
  application deployment should consume the container image from the container
  registry.
- Deploy the Microservice (LO2, LO4)
- Use managed container orchestration services provided by your cloud service provider
  to deploy the containerized microservice.
- You can use cloud specific services like ECS (Elastic Container Service)/ Azure
  Container Apps etc..
- You have the freedom to even use managed Kubernetes services provided by
  your chosen cloud service provider.

### B.Sc. (Hons) in Information Technology Specializing in Software Engineering Year 4 Ensure the microservice is accessible over the internet

- Integrate Basic Security Measures (LO2, LO4)
- Implement basic security best practices (like using IAM roles, security groups etc,,).
- Ensure the microservice handles data securely and follows principles of least privilege.
- Integrate managed SAST tools like SonarCloud or Snyk to enable DevSecOps practices
  to your microservice development.

##### Deliverables

- Project Report (should only cover following components):
- Architecture diagram of the microservice.
- Description and rationale of the chosen microservice.
- Overview of the DevOps and security practices implemented.
- Any challenges faced and how they were addressed.

##### Code Repository

- Access to the version-controlled repository with all source code.

##### Demonstration

- A working prototype of the microservice deployed on chosen cloud service provider.
- Demonstration of the CI/CD process.
